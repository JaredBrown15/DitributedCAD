Final Project for Distributed Computing Course

Flask server runs on localhost:8000 and connects to jaredwjbrown.com via a CloudFlare Tunnel.
Site may be down as I do not leave the server running on my PC.

wala_run.py runs the WaLa model locally on my PC GPU. The resources for the WaLa model can be found here: https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/WaLa

GUI component was not completed as I shifted from my initial GUI implementation to a public facing domain implementation.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.
